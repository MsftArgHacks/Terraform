[Back](/Hack/challenge01.md) - [Home](README.md) - [Next](/Hack/challenge03.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

1. [What is version control?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/git/what-is-version-control)
2. [What is Git?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/git/what-is-git)
3. [What is a GitHub?](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github)

### Discussion

1. Think scenarios where one Develop Team develops and maintains the application at the same time that the IT Team works on Infrastructure.
2. What do you think should be folder structure?
   1. HINT: Check the Reference Diagram:

3. After seeing the Reference Diagram, Discuss its advantages and disadvantages. What folder structure will you implement?.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, let's get some code checked into source control.

1. Create a repo in GitHu and initialize it.([hint](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo)).
2. Clone this repo to your local computer ([hint](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)).
3. Create Folder Structure.

- Recomendation: Create one repo for the Infrastructure and another for the App.

### Success Criteria

1. You should be able to go to the GitHub site and browse your folder structure.
2. You should be able to have the GitHub Repo cloned in your machine.
